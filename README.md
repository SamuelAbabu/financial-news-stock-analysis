# Financial-News-stock- Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing a dataset of market-related news articles to uncover insights through various exploratory and text analyses. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, publisher activity, temporal trends, topic modeling, and publisher contributions.

## Repository Setup & Workflow

- **Repository Creation:** A GitHub repository has been created to host all project code and documentation.
- **Branching Strategy:** A new branch named `task-1` has been created for this analysis.
- **Commit Frequency:** Work has been committed at least three times daily with descriptive messages.

## Data Analysis Overview

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Calculated basic statistics for text lengths (e.g., headline length) to understand size distribution.
- Counted the number of articles per publisher to identify the most active sources.
- Analyzed publication dates to discover news frequency trends over time, including peaks during significant events or specific days of the week.

### 2. Text Analysis (Topic Modeling)
- Utilized natural language processing techniques to extract common keywords and phrases.
- Identified probable topics and significant themes in the dataset such as "FDA approval," "price target," etc.

### 3. Time Series Analysis
- Investigated how article publication frequency varies over time.
- Detected spikes corresponding to specific market events.
- Analyzed publishing times to find patterns, such as peak times during the day when most news is releasedâ€”useful for trading strategies.

### 4. Publisher Analysis
- Determined which publishers contribute most frequently to the news feed.
- Analyzed publisher differences to differentiate reporting styles or focus areas.
- If email addresses are used for publisher names, extracted and summarized unique domains to identify organizational contributors.
